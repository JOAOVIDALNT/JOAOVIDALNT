Hi! I'm Jo√£o Vidal from Brazil I'm 22 years old <br>
I'm currently studying nodejs <br>
I have some experience with html and css but since i've start my javascript studies I choose backend to begin.
Someday I'll be back to frontend and learn some React or maybe React Native(?)

I'm this confuse guy, who loves technology since 9 years old but had some thraumatic experience at my first job when I was 15 year old.
Isn't easy grow up as a black kid, I had no space to dream so.. I'm dreaming now while I've to run against the clock. At least I'm doing what I love.

I learned english by myself so I'm midlevel, you must have notice by this text but I like to do this with no translate, on my own and I'm looking to improve.
This desire to improve moves me foward and that's why I'm here.
